# writing-a-csv-file-into-smaller-csv-files
In this program, we take the file 'sales.csv', which covers data of a two and a half year span (01-2003 to 05-2005), preprocess it and divide it into weeks. We then write one csv file per week having as title the first date of the corresponding week. Hence, the code returns 126 smaller csv files.
